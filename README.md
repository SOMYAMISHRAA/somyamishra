# 🛒 Market Basket Analysis using Apriori Algorithm

This project applies **association rule mining** using the **Apriori algorithm** to analyze customer purchase behavior and generate useful insights. It also simulates a classification-type problem with a **confusion matrix** and key **evaluation metrics** like **accuracy**, **precision**, and **recall**.

## 🚀 Features

✅ One-hot encoding of market basket data  
✅ Frequent itemset mining using **Apriori**  
✅ Generation of **association rules** (lift, confidence, support)  
✅ Top itemset **visualizations**  
✅ Simulated classification using two items  
✅ **Confusion Matrix + Accuracy, Precision, Recall**  
✅ Handles edge cases gracefully (e.g. missing items)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Google Colab)
- `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `mlxtend` (for Apriori & association rules)
- `sklearn` (for evaluation metrics)

## 📈 Output Sample

- Top Frequent Itemsets bar chart  
- Top Association Rules (e.g., Milk → Bread)  
- Confusion Matrix Heatmap  
- Accuracy: `0.98+`, Precision: `0.0`, Recall: `0.0` *(based on simulated classification)*
